# Modern Terminals

As discussed in the last chapter, a lot of what we do is done in computational notebooks. But, for better or worse, we still do need to use the terminal for quite a lot of things. In this chapter I'll give a quick overview of a bunch of tools I use to make using the terminal nicer.

IN PROGESS!!! :)

## Conda

(probably going to be its own section)

A ecosystem for installing precompiled packages, and managing virtual environments. Works across programming languages, and has bioinformatics-specific teams/projects.

## rsync

**The** way to copy files. (also rclone)

## Tmux

Tmux gives your terminal persistent tabs. For those old enough to remember a time before tabs in web browsers, you'll know the dramatic improvements to productivity they bought.

## NCDU

A tremendously useful tool that allows semi-graphical exploration of a folder and all contents.


## rmlint

A tool to de-duplicate files, and clean up any weird 'lint' from the file system.

## Zsh

An alternative shell, that dramatically improves productivity. Comes with a lot of time-saving shortcuts that Bash lacks.
