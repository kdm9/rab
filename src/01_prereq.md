# Prerequisite knowledge

This book is important for all levels of computational experience. However, to keep this book focused I assume a comfortable level of familiarity with the following topics:


If this is your first real foray into heavy bioinformatics, I highly recommend 
## Bash/Shell

If you can't confidently answer the following questions, brush up on your shell knowledge with the resources below.

- What do `cd`, `ls`, and `mkdir` do?
- If I am in the directory `/home/kevin/work/test`, name two ways to `cd` to `/home`
- How do I set the variable `frog` to the string value `Littoria`?
- How do I print the value of the variable `frog`?
- How do I loop through the numbers 1 to 10? And how about the looping through the files in the current directory?


If there were bits of the above you weren't confident about, consider the following:

- The software carpentry shell-novice command takes you from zero knowledge to the basics
- Learn Bash in X minutes is a very condensed refresher course for those who once knew the above, or who know all the principles involved.


## Basic git

If you can't answer the following, then avail yourself of the resources below:

- Approximately how does git work?
- What is a commit, and how does it differ from a branch?
- What is a staged file, and how does one stage it?
- How to I get git to send and receive changes from a remote repository?
- What's the typical cycle of git commands needed to share a change with a remote repository?

- For complete beginners, the software carpentry git course is great
- For more advanced topics, the git tutorial itself is even better
- For a quick refresher, again learn git in X minutes is very concise


## Some basic common bioinformatics knowledge

This is less critical, especially if this isn't your field, but I might mention the following terms. If you're unfamiliar, most of this book cites external tutorials that explain these workflows/pipelines in detail.

For example, ideally you'd be familiar with the following terms:

- Illumina/short read sequencing
- Alignment to a reference genome, and BAM files
- Variant calls, and the broader concept of population genetic variation.

As I say, these are mainly motivating examples, so if these have no relevance to your work then feel free to remain in blissful ignorance of this cursed field. But, if you're starting out as a bioinformatics student, take the time to learn these concepts.
